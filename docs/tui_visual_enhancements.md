# TUI Visual Enhancements

## Overview

The claudelytics TUI has been enhanced with several visual improvements to provide a more responsive and visually appealing user experience.

## New Visual Features

### 1. Loading Animations

The TUI now includes smooth loading animations using Unicode braille patterns that rotate when data is being loaded:

- **Braille Pattern**: ⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏ (default)
- **Dots Pattern**: ⣾⣽⣻⢿⡿⣟⣯⣷
- **Spinner Pattern**: ◐◓◑◒
- **Progress Pattern**: ▱▱▱ → ▰▱▱ → ▰▰▱ → ▰▰▰

These animations appear when:
- Refreshing data (pressing 'r')
- Loading Claude sessions in the Resume tab
- Any long-running operation

### 2. Smooth Progress Bars

The Overview tab now includes animated progress bars that smoothly transition to their target values:

- **Cost Progress Bar**: Shows daily cost usage with color-coded thresholds
  - Green: < $3.33
  - Yellow: $3.33 - $6.66
  - Red: > $6.66
  
- **Token Usage Progress Bar**: Displays token consumption with a blue gradient

### 3. Key Press Visual Feedback

Every key press now shows a brief visual flash effect at the bottom of the screen, providing immediate feedback that the key was registered. This is especially useful for:
- Mode switches (1-6 for tabs)
- Action keys (r, s, f, etc.)
- Navigation keys

### 4. Toast Notifications

Non-intrusive toast notifications appear in the top-right corner for important events:
- **Success** (green): Data refreshed, bookmarks added
- **Info** (blue): Tab switches, mode changes
- **Warning** (yellow): Approaching limits
- **Error** (red): Failed operations

Toasts automatically fade out after 3-5 seconds.

### 5. Enhanced Status Bar

The bottom status bar now shows real-time information:
- Current mode (Normal, Search, Visual, Command, Export)
- Active filters and sort settings
- Item count and selection position
- Context-sensitive key hints
- Live clock

### 6. Visual Mode Enhancements

Visual mode selections now have better highlighting with yellow background to clearly show selected items.

## Usage Examples

### Refreshing Data
When you press 'r' to refresh:
1. A loading animation appears with "Refreshing data..." message
2. Key press effect shows 'r' was pressed
3. Success toast appears when complete

### Switching Tabs
When switching between tabs (1-6):
1. Key press effect flashes
2. Info toast shows "Switched to [Tab Name]"
3. Status bar updates with new context

### Bookmarking Sessions
When pressing 'b' to bookmark:
1. Key press effect for 'b'
2. Success toast with bookmark confirmation
3. Status message updates

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The visual enhancements are implemented in a separate module (`tui_visuals.rs`) that provides:

- `VisualEffectsManager`: Central manager for all visual effects
- `LoadingAnimation`: Configurable loading spinners
- `SmoothProgressBar`: Animated progress indicators
- `KeyPressEffect`: Visual feedback for keyboard input
- `ToastNotification`: Temporary notification system
- `EnhancedStatusBar`: Real-time status information

### Performance

All visual effects are optimized for performance:
- Animations update only when visible
- Effects are automatically cleaned up when expired
- Smooth animations use interpolation for fluid motion
- Minimal redraw regions for efficiency

### Customization

Visual effects can be customized:
- Animation styles and speeds
- Color schemes for progress bars
- Toast notification positions and durations
- Status bar information display

## Future Enhancements

Potential future visual improvements:
- Particle effects for major actions
- Smooth scrolling animations
- Chart animations with transitions
- Theme customization support
- Sound effects (optional)
- Mouse hover effects
