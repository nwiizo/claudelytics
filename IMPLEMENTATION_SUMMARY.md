- Display mode: Show pre-calculated costs from JSONL

### 5. Tests for New Features (High Priority)
- Unit tests for billing block calculations
- Integration tests for pricing cache
- Test coverage for new command handlers

## Key Differences from ccusage

### Architecture
- **claudelytics**: Rust-based, focuses on performance and comprehensive analytics
- **ccusage**: TypeScript-based, focuses on JavaScript ecosystem integration

### Unique claudelytics Features
- Advanced TUI with multiple tabs and interactive features
- Session-level analytics and comparison
- Git integration analysis (planned)
- Machine learning insights (planned)
- Export to CSV functionality
- Real-time file watching
- Interactive session selector

### Unique ccusage Features Still Missing
- Multi-package manager support (npm/bun/pnpm)
- Direct API integration for real-time pricing updates
- Some specific projection algorithms

## Usage Examples

### Advanced Analytics
```bash
# Show all analytics
claudelytics analytics

# Time of day patterns only
claudelytics analytics --time-of-day

# Day of week analysis
claudelytics analytics --day-of-week

# Session duration patterns
claudelytics analytics --duration

# Frequency and streak analysis
claudelytics analytics --frequency

# Cost efficiency with custom threshold
claudelytics analytics --efficiency --threshold 5.0

# Combine multiple analyses
claudelytics analytics --time-of-day --efficiency
```

### Billing Blocks
```bash
# View all billing blocks
claudelytics billing-blocks

# View with summary statistics
claudelytics billing-blocks --summary

# Classic table format
claudelytics billing-blocks --classic

# JSON output for scripting
claudelytics billing-blocks --json

# Filter by date
claudelytics --since 20240301 billing-blocks
```

### Pricing Cache
```bash
# Check cache status
claudelytics pricing-cache --show

# Update cache
claudelytics pricing-cache --update

# Clear cache (force fallback pricing)
claudelytics pricing-cache --clear
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement usage projections with time-series forecasting
2. Add flexible cost calculation modes
3. Write comprehensive tests for new features
4. Consider adding online pricing API integration
5. Enhance billing blocks with more analytics (trends, predictions)

# TUI Resume Tab Input Buffer Implementation

## Overview
Added an interactive input buffer system to the TUI's Resume tab that allows users to send messages directly to Claude sessions without leaving the TUI interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Fields Added to TuiApp
```rust
// Resume input buffer
resume_input_mode: bool,        // Tracks if we're in input mode
resume_input_buffer: String,    // Stores the user's message
resume_input_cursor: usize,     // Cursor position for text editing
```

### 2. New AppMode Variant
```rust
enum AppMode {
    Normal,
    CommandPalette,
    Search,
    ResumeInput,  // New mode for resume input
}
```

### 3. Key Features

#### Input Mode Activation
- Press 'i' key in Resume tab to enter input mode
- Shows a yellow-bordered input area at the bottom of the screen
- Displays placeholder text "Type your message here..." when empty

#### Text Editing Capabilities
- **Character Input**: Type normally to add text
- **Backspace**: Delete character before cursor
- **Arrow Keys**: Left/Right to move cursor
- **Home/End**: Jump to beginning/end of text
- **Visual Cursor**: Shows '_' at end or '|' within text

#### Message Handling
- **Enter**: Send the message (currently shows in status area)
- **Esc**: Cancel input and clear buffer
- Status message displays the session name and message content

### 4. UI Layout Changes
When in input mode, the Resume tab layout adjusts to show:
1. Controls section (3 lines)
2. Sessions table (minimum 10 lines)
3. Input area (3 lines)

### 5. Future Enhancement Points

The `send_resume_message` function currently shows a status message but includes TODO comments for full implementation:

```rust
// TODO: Implement actual message sending logic here
// This would involve:
// - Loading the full conversation from the session file
// - Adding the user's message
// - Optionally calling Claude API for a response
// - Saving the updated conversation back to the file
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to Resume tab (press '5' or use Tab)
2. Load sessions if needed (press 'r')
3. Select a session with arrow keys
4. Press 'i' to enter input mode
5. Type your message
6. Press Enter to send (or Esc to cancel)

## Benefits

- **Seamless Workflow**: Continue conversations without leaving the TUI
- **Familiar Editing**: Standard text editing controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of input mode and cursor position
- **Non-Intrusive**: Only appears when activated

## Technical Considerations

- The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase (search and command palette)
- All tests pass and the code is properly formatted
- The feature is ready for future enhancement to actually send messages to Claude API
- Input handling is consistent with other TUI modes
