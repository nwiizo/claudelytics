# Implementation Summary - ccusage Features in claudelytics

## Completed Features

### 1. 5-Hour Billing Block Tracking ✅
- Added `billing_blocks.rs` module with comprehensive billing block management
- Tracks usage in Claude's actual 5-hour billing periods (00:00-05:00, 05:00-10:00, etc.)
- Features:
  - Automatic aggregation of usage data into billing blocks
  - Peak usage block identification
  - Average usage per block calculation
  - Usage patterns by time of day
  - Enhanced and classic display formats
- Command: `claudelytics billing-blocks [--summary] [--classic] [--json]`

### 2. Offline Pricing Cache ✅
- Added `pricing_cache.rs` module for offline pricing data storage
- Features:
  - 7-day cache validity period
  - Automatic fallback to built-in pricing when cache is invalid/missing
  - Version-aware cache (invalidates on app version change)
  - Cache stored in platform-appropriate location (e.g., ~/.cache/claudelytics/)
- Commands:
  - `claudelytics pricing-cache --show` - Display cache status
  - `claudelytics pricing-cache --clear` - Clear cached data
  - `claudelytics pricing-cache --update` - Update cache with latest data

## Features Not Yet Implemented

### 3. Usage Projections (Medium Priority)
- Estimate when usage limits might be reached
- Predict future usage based on historical patterns
- Alert when approaching budget limits

### 4. Flexible Cost Calculation Modes (Medium Priority)
- Auto mode: Automatically determine best calculation method
- Calculate mode: Always recalculate from token counts
- Display mode: Show pre-calculated costs from JSONL

### 5. Tests for New Features (High Priority)
- Unit tests for billing block calculations
- Integration tests for pricing cache
- Test coverage for new command handlers

## Key Differences from ccusage

### Architecture
- **claudelytics**: Rust-based, focuses on performance and comprehensive analytics
- **ccusage**: TypeScript-based, focuses on JavaScript ecosystem integration

### Unique claudelytics Features
- Advanced TUI with multiple tabs and interactive features
- Session-level analytics and comparison
- Git integration analysis (planned)
- Machine learning insights (planned)
- Export to CSV functionality
- Real-time file watching
- Interactive session selector

### Unique ccusage Features Still Missing
- Multi-package manager support (npm/bun/pnpm)
- Direct API integration for real-time pricing updates
- Some specific projection algorithms

## Usage Examples

### Billing Blocks
```bash
# View all billing blocks
claudelytics billing-blocks

# View with summary statistics
claudelytics billing-blocks --summary

# Classic table format
claudelytics billing-blocks --classic

# JSON output for scripting
claudelytics billing-blocks --json

# Filter by date
claudelytics --since 20240301 billing-blocks
```

### Pricing Cache
```bash
# Check cache status
claudelytics pricing-cache --show

# Update cache
claudelytics pricing-cache --update

# Clear cache (force fallback pricing)
claudelytics pricing-cache --clear
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement usage projections with time-series forecasting
2. Add flexible cost calculation modes
3. Write comprehensive tests for new features
4. Consider adding online pricing API integration
5. Enhance billing blocks with more analytics (trends, predictions)
